<h1>Spring Boot Project with implementation of GraphQL and H2 DB</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is learning project in which I have implemented api testing using graphql and in-memory database H2. Using it we can perform the crud operation on server side.</p>
<p>GraphQl is efficient for testing API. It works on model of provide only which are asked. The REST APIs return all the details about a paritcular object while using GraphQL, we can ask for only which fields we want and we have use. There is two main things in GrpahQL - Query and Mutation</p>
<p>Query handles all the get request which is for fetching data from the database while Mutation is used to perform manipulation on databases that is create, update and delete.</p>
